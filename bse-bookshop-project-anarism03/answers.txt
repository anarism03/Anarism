Q-1: What is GIT? 
Git is a DevOps tool used for source code management. 
It is a free and open-source version control system used to handle small to very large projects efficiently.
 Git is used to tracking changes in the source code, enabling multiple developers to work together on non-linear development.

 Q-2:Why We use it?
We use Git for version control in software development to track changes in source code,
 enabling collaboration among multiple developers.
  It allows for efficient management of codebase history, facilitates seamless integration of changes through branching and merging, 
  and provides a robust mechanism for collaboration and code review

  Q-3::What is GitHub?
  GitHub is a web-based platform that provides hosting services for Git repositories.
   It offers a collaborative environment for software development, enabling developers to store, share, and manage their code repositories.
    GitHub enhances the Git workflow by adding features such as issue tracking, pull requests,
     and code review tools, making it a popular choice for open-source projects and collaborative development teams.

     Q-4: How the web browser works?
     A web browser works by taking user input, typically in the form of a URL, and sending an HTTP request to the corresponding server.
      The server processes the request, sends back HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, and the browser's rendering engine interprets and renders
       these files to display the visual representation of the webpage.
        This process involves translating domain names to IP addresses, handling security through HTTPS, and constructing a Document Object Model
         (DOM) to manage the webpage's structure and content.
         
         Q-5:What are HTML tags for?
HTML tags are used to structure and format content within a web page. 
They define the elements and hierarchy of a document, allowing browsers to interpret and display the content as intended.
 Tags are written in the form of opening and closing pairs (e.g., <p> for paragraphs), and they encapsulate 
 different types of content such as text, images, links, and more, providing a standardized way to create and organize information on the web.

 Q-6:What are Attributes for?
Attributes in HTML provide additional information about HTML elements and help define their behavior or appearance.
 They are included within the opening tag of an element and consist of a name-value pair. Attributes can control various aspects, 
 such as linking elements, specifying image sources, setting styles, or defining behavior through JavaScript, 
 enhancing the functionality and presentation of web content.

 Q-7:What is meta tags?
 Meta tags in HTML provide metadata about the HTML document itself, offering information that is not displayed on the web page
  but is used by browsers and search engines. Common meta tags include the description of the page's content, keywords relevant
   to the page's topic, character set information, and viewport settings for responsive design. These tags play a crucial role
    in search engine optimization (SEO) and help browsers and other applications understand and appropriately display the webpage.

    Q-8:What are the semantic tags and why i need to use it?
    Semantic tags in HTML, such as <header>, <nav>, <main>, <article>, <section>, <footer>, etc., 
    provide meaning and structure to the content, making it more understandable for both browsers and developers. 
    By using semantic tags, you create a clearer and more accessible document structure, which improves search engine optimization 
    (SEO) and enhances the overall readability of your code. Additionally, assistive technologies, like screen readers,
     can better interpret the content, improving the experience for users with disabilities.

Day-2
Q-1:What does CSS do?
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to control the presentation and layout of HTML documents.
 It allows web developers to define styles, such as fonts, colors, spacing, and positioning, to ensure a consistent and visually 
 appealing appearance across various devices and screen sizes. CSS enables the separation of content and presentation, 
making it easier to manage and update the design of a website.

Q-2:What are CSS selectors for?
CSS selectors are used to target and style specific HTML elements within a document.
 They define rules for applying styles to elements based on their type, class, ID, attributes,
or their position within the document structure. CSS selectors play a crucial role in enabling developers to precisely
specify which elements should receive particular styling, providing flexibility and control over the visual presentation
of a webpage.

Q-3:Css usage methods. Advantages and disadvantages of these methods.
CSS can be applied to HTML documents using three main methods: inline styles, internal styles, and external stylesheets.
Inline styles involve adding style attributes directly to HTML elements, offering quick application but leading to less maintainable code.
 Internal styles use the <style> tag within the HTML document, allowing for better organization but still mixing content with presentation.
  External stylesheets involve a separate CSS file linked to the HTML, promoting a clean separation of concerns but requiring an additional 
  HTTP request. The choice between these methods depends on factors like project size, maintainability, and reusability.

  //////////////////////////////////
  Day-3
  Q-1:Why we need CSS reset?
  A CSS reset is used to normalize the default styles applied by browsers to HTML elements, ensuring a consistent
   starting point for styling across different browsers. This helps web developers avoid inconsistencies
    and variations in rendering, making it easier to create a cohesive and predictable design across various
     platforms. CSS resets typically zero out default margin, padding, and other styles to provide a clean
      slate for developers to build upon without unexpected browser-specific stylings.

      
      Q-2: What are the advantages of using fonts instead of images as icons?
      Using fonts for icons instead of images offers several advantages. Fonts allow for scalable 
      and resolution-independent icons, ensuring they look sharp on various devices and screen sizes.
       Additionally, using fonts improves performance as they are lightweight, reducing page load times
        compared to image-based icons. Lastly, fonts offer flexibility through CSS styling, enabling easy 
        color changes, size adjustments, and other styling modifications without the need for additional 
     image assets.

     It simplifies the alignment and distribution of elements within a container, providing a more efficient and flexible
      way to create dynamic and responsive user interfaces in front-end development.
      
      Q-2:What are the key advantages of using Flexbox for layout in front-end development?
     Flexbox offers a simplified and efficient way to create complex layouts, providing a consistent and responsive
 design across different screen sizes and devices. Its key advantages include easy alignment and distribution of
  items, automatic adjustment to container sizes, and reduced reliance on floats and positioning, leading to more
   maintainable and adaptable front-end code.

   Q-3:How does Flexbox differ from traditional CSS layout methods like floats and positioning?
Flexbox differs from traditional CSS layout methods like floats and positioning by providing a more
 efficient and predictable way to design complex layouts. Unlike floats, Flexbox allows for easy 
 alignment and distribution of items within a container without the need for clearing or clearfix
  hacks. It also eliminates the need for explicit positioning, offering a more responsive approach
   where items can adapt automatically to varying screen sizes and content changes. Overall, Flexbox
    simplifies the process of creating flexible and dynamic layouts, reducing the complexity and 
    potential pitfalls associated with traditional methods.

    Q-4:What are the main properties and values used in Flexbox for controlling layout and alignment?
The main properties in Flexbox for controlling layout and alignment include display: flex; to establish a flex container,
 flex-direction to set the direction of the main axis, justify-content for aligning items along the main axis, and align-items
  for aligning items along the cross axis. Additionally, the flex property is crucial for specifying the flexibility of individual items
   within the container, enabling developers to create responsive and dynamic layouts with precise control over spacing and alignment.

Q-5:How does the flex-direction property affect the flow of elements in a Flexbox container?
The flex-direction property in Flexbox determines the primary axis along which the flex container's items are placed.
 By setting values such as row, row-reverse, column, or column-reverse, developers can control whether the items flow
  horizontally from left to right, right to left, vertically from top to bottom, or bottom to top, respectively. 
  This property significantly influences the layout flow, allowing for flexible control over the arrangement of elements
   within the Flexbox container.

Q-6:What are the differences between the justify-content and align-items properties in Flexbox?
In Flexbox, the justify-content property is used to align items along the main axis, either horizontally
 (for a row-oriented layout) or vertically (for a column-oriented layout). On the other hand, the align-items property
  is used to align items along the cross axis, which is perpendicular to the main axis.

  Q-7:What are some common use cases for Flexbox in front-end development?
  Flexbox is commonly used in front-end development for creating responsive and flexible layouts,
   allowing for efficient distribution and alignment of items within a container. It is particularly
    useful for designing navigation bars, grid systems, and centering elements, providing a powerful
     tool for building dynamic and adaptable user interfaces.

   Q-8:What is the role of the flex-grow and flex-shrink properties in controlling the behavior of Flexbox items?  
The flex-grow property in Flexbox controls the ability of a flex item to grow relative to the other items within the container.
 A higher flex-grow value means the item will take up more available space when there is extra space in the container.
  Conversely, the flex-shrink property determines the ability of a flex item to shrink relative to the other items when
   there is not enough space in the container. A higher flex-shrink value makes the item shrink more compared to other 
   items in the container when space is constrained.

Q-9:How can you center elements both horizontally and vertically using Flexbox?
.container{
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;}
This combination of justify-content: center
 and align-items: center
  ensures that the child elements are centered along both the horizontal and vertical axes within the flex container.

  Q-10:What is the purpose of the flex-basis property in Flexbox?
The flex-basis property in Flexbox defines the initial size of a flex item along the main axis 
before any remaining space is distributed. It sets the starting size of the item, and when used 
with the flex shorthand property, it combines with flex-grow and flex-shrink to determine the final size of the item within the flex container.
